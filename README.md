# Type Error in TypeScript Addition
This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when performing arithmetic operations with incompatible types. Specifically, the `add` function is designed to accept two numbers as input and return their sum. However, the code calls this function with a number and a string as arguments, resulting in a type error. This issue highlights the importance of type checking in TypeScript and how it helps prevent runtime errors caused by incompatible types.
